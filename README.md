# Sudoku-Solver-Parallel
This project is motivated by the increase in popularity of Sudoku and similar logic puzzles over the past decade . Numerous serial Sudoku solver implementations exist and are readily available. However, due to its recency, there is relatively little work on parallel implementations. Parallelizing a serial Sudoku solver can improve its speed and increase the viability of solving larger size Sudokus. The Sudoku solver algorithm also conveys some of the basic tradeoffs of parallel software development such as dependencies and work-sharing which are interesting to inspect and study. We propose that a method for solving the puzzle quickly will be derived that takes advantage of many core architecture on modern and future computer systems which will bring down the time cost of solving an NxN Sudoku to a reasonable amount. Our goal is to allow for the algorithm to take advantage of the many-core architecture to further reduce its running time. This is very important and is at the heart of our work because for large N, the number of cells per row and column in the Sudoku grid, finding a solution becomes an extremely difficult and computationally intensive problem. Hence, the parallel algorithm must also scale as the grid size increases.
